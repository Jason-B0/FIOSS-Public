Also known as Field Intelligence Operation Support System, or FIOSS in short, this is an in-game UI system designed to mimic a secure database terminal and enables the ability to view player profiles, send/receive messages, and upload various documents and journals.

This project is coded in LuaU using Roact and Knit framework, as well as other dependencies.

This is a private project with a very small portion of it released as a part of my personal showcase with full permission from the team.  It is not a full version of the system.
